\subsection{Sound Effects}
\label{subsec:SoundFX}

First, the sound effects assets are from two different sources.
The \nth{1} source is the \textit{Grenade Sound FX}.
This is what I used for the bomb explosion noise when the player uncovers a bomb.

The \nth{2} source is the \textit{Casual Games SFX Pack}.
All other sound effects that were used were obtained from this asset pack, ranging from the menu clicks, to the flag placement.

\subsection{Music}
\label{subsec:Music}

The music I had previously paid for from a Humble Bundle Pack about a year ago.
The music is by an artist named Joel Steudler who provides a variety of different tracks with themes associated.

I would like to express my appreciation to the folks who generously provided the audio assets for use in this project.

Thank you.
