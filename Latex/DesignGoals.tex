\section{Design Goals}
\label{sec:DesignGoals}

The design priorities for the game are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The design should be efficient in space complexity.
    Additionally, the design should aim to be as simplistic, yet effective as possible.
    This is to reduce design complexity and maximize effort put forth in development.
    \item This project was developed by one person, so understanding the limitations of my own abilities was paramount when designing and implementing the game.
    \item Utilize the code given as an outline from the professor to further enhance the quality of the project.
\end{itemize}
