Because this project was made in unity, it utilizes a file made by unity to handle crashes.
This file is called Unity \textit{UnityCrashHandler64.exe} within the file system.

When downloading the release version from the Github repository previously mentioned in \ref{subsec:BackgroundInfo}, the build is downloaded as a zip file.
When unzipped, there lies the Crash Handler from Unity alongside the exe file to run the game.
The .exe file to run the game is called \textit{MineSweeper.exe}.

The zipped folder is 39MB large.
When unzipped, the size grows to 81MB.

If any bug fixes should occur, then by releasing the changes under the main branch, I will be able to pull the changes on the release branch.
From the release branch, I can release the update so that people wanting to download the new version are able to.

Because I am not monetizing this project, I don't expect legal issues.
If required I can also utilize a License for distribution to overcome such issues.
