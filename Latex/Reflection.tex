I really enjoyed this project.
I have never worked in Unity before, and it certainly was a struggle to learn how to utilize the tools that Unity offers, since they are presented differently from Unreal Engine.
I have actually been wanting to make MineSweeper for about a year now, but wasn't sure what teach stack to use, so this was a great opportunity to combine a personal project and a school project.

My biggest difficulty, was trying to wrap my head around combining the code and the elements within the Unity Editor.
It just seemed so odd to me to attach scripts to components and assign behaviors/events both in and out of code.
My familiarity with Unreal Engine was of no help in this case, however my experience did help with understanding the way the Unity System utilizes the language and the libaries provided.
